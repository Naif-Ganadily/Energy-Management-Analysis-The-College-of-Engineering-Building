# Energy-Management-Analysis-The-College-of-Engineering-Building
In September 2020, I was voted as Senior Project Leader, leading a team of 5 including myself to construct a well-deserved full analysis project in the electrical engineering domain. For 12 months we have been collecting Data on our College of engineering building to understand energy leakage. We have conducted a full Data Science Analysis Lifecycle with an add-on of Electrical Engineering Solutions.
